## ✅ Migration Completed

Date: 2025-08-27T09:12:06.556Z

### Packages Migrated (MOVED - Not Copied)
- ✅ @tamyla/ui-components → packages/ui-components
- ✅ @tamyla/ui-components-react → packages/ui-components-react

### Migration Approach
- **MOVED** source code (no duplication)
- **EXCLUDED** build artifacts (node_modules, dist, .git)
- **PRESERVED** all source files and configurations
- **NO** legacy symlinks created (not needed)

### Workspace Configuration
- Updated package.json for workspace compatibility
- Added workspace-specific scripts
- Updated inter-package dependencies

### Next Steps
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Build packages: `npm run build`
3. Run tests: `npm run test`
4. Publish from platform: `npm run publish:all`

### Breaking Changes
None - packages maintain full functional compatibility

### Original Directories
Original directories cleaned up automatically after successful migration.
If any important files remained, a marker file was created.

### Migration Script
This migration was performed by: `scripts/migrate-packages.js`
